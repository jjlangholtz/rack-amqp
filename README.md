# Rack-AMQP

This project is a suite of tools to run Rack-based web applications over
AMQP instead of over HTTP.

## Projects

* The [AMQP-HTTP RFC](https://github.com/rack-amqp/rack-amqp/blob/master/amqp-http.rfc) for background and protocol details
* [Jackalope](https://github.com/rack-amqp/jackalope) is the Rack-AMQP server
* [AMQParty](https://github.com/rack-amqp/amqparty) is an API-compatible replacement for HTTParty for use as a client to Rack-AMQP-served applications
* [AMQurl](https://github.com/rack-amqp/amqurl) is an API-compatible replacement for `curl` for use with Rack-AMQP apps
* [Rack-AMQP-Client](https://github.com/rack-amqp/rack-amqp-client) is a ruby client for accessing Rack-AMQP servers
* [Rails-Demo](https://github.com/rack-amqp/rails-demo) is a set of demo rails apps that use the benefits from Rack-AMQP

## Goals

* Make SOAs built with pub-sub easy
* Be fast
* Be secure
